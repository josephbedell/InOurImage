<p>Zoe Carter stood in line at Terminal 3 of San Francisco International, the glowing edges of dawn reflecting off the glass, her passport and encrypted invitation clutched in one hand, her Faraday-shielded phone in the other. She wasn’t just headed to Jerusalem—she was heading straight into the unknown. The invitation had no sender, no return address, just a masked IP from Geneva and a cryptic reference to <a href="https://blb.sc/002QA2">Psalm 119</a>, a love letter to the Hebrew alephbet itself. Whoever sent it understood both scripture and security.</p><p>She double-checked her gear: a stripped-down ThinkPad running custom Tails OS, a printed backup of her passport folded into her laptop sleeve, two SSDs encrypted with her PGP key, and a slim USB running custom scripts—including a modified <code>blastp.py</code> alignment tool. The original method was immortalized in the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/blast/0596002998/">BLAST book</a>, still a standard reference for sequence alignment. (Fun fact: the author of this story co-wrote that book.)</p><p>The flight to Tel Aviv was uneventful but long—nearly 14 hours over the Rockies, the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean. Zoe alternated between napping and scanning recent updates from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">NCBI GenBank</a>, flagging neural-related coding regions for <em>FOXO3A</em> and <em>NRG1</em>, genes long thought to be key to developmental timing and cognition. Somewhere over the Balkans, she was still staring at a draft <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_code#Equidistant_letter_sequence_method">ELS matrix</a> from the Book of Leviticus when she finally gave in to sleep.</p><h2>From the Airport to the Walls of Time</h2><p>The heat struck her immediately as she stepped out of Ben Gurion Airport. Warm, dry air carried a scent of olive trees, sand, and dust—as if time itself had a smell. Her driver, a man named Naim, drove her east toward Jerusalem. The road climbed steadily through the Judean Hills, their terraces carved with ancient care, dotted with goats, solar panels, and the occasional drone overhead.</p><p>When they crested the ridge near <a href="https://www.parks.org.il/reserve-park/%D7%92%D7%9F-%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%99-%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%93/">Ein Hemed National Park</a>, the full panorama of Jerusalem opened before her like a scroll: domes, minarets, crenellated walls. The Old City shimmered in the late-afternoon light, its stones stained gold by centuries of setting suns.</p><p>They entered through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_Gate">Jaffa Gate</a>, and Zoe was instantly enveloped in the centuries. Hebrew, Arabic, Latin—it was all here, folded together like palimpsests.</p><h2>Four Quarters, Four Worlds</h2><p>Zoe had been briefed. The Old City’s four quarters were each their own chronotype:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Jewish Quarter</strong>: Stalls selling braided challah, shofars, and printed Torah scrolls lined the stone walkways. Yeshiva boys in pressed white shirts huddled over <a href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-mishnah/">Mishnah</a>, murmuring in debate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Christian Quarter</strong>: Lanterns flickered outside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre">Church of the Holy Sepulchre</a>. Pilgrims knelt in the silence of stone. A Coptic priest swept incense around a carved wooden cross worn smooth by centuries of touch.</p></li><li><p><strong>Muslim Quarter</strong>: The smell of fresh kanafeh and grilled eggplant rose like steam. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhan">Adhan</a>from the minarets wove into the hum of the bazaar.</p></li><li><p><strong>Armenian Quarter</strong>: Smallest and quietest, with its own timekeeping. In the courtyard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Saint_James,_Jerusalem">St. James’s Cathedral</a>, an old monk lit candles whose wax had pooled like memory.</p></li></ul><p>She stayed at a pension not far from the Damascus Gate, run by an elderly Christian Arab woman who served her thick coffee spiced with cardamom. The rooftop terrace gave a panorama of domes, towers, and the golden flash of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome_of_the_Rock">Dome of the Rock</a> just beyond the wall.</p><h2>Rooftop Memory</h2><p>That night, as the city hushed and wind moved through bougainvillea, Zoe climbed back onto the rooftop terrace. Another guest was already there—an Australian linguist named Mattias, barefoot, cross-legged, sketching something in a notebook. He nodded as she approached.</p><p>“Can’t sleep?” he asked.</p><p>Zoe shook her head. “Too much spinning.”</p><p>Mattias gestured toward the view. “Hard place to quiet the mind. Even the stones are loud.”</p><p>They talked—quietly, slowly. He was researching root structures in pre-Aramaic inscriptions and had stumbled across the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_Geniza">Cairo Geniza</a> corpus. Zoe didn’t share everything, but mentioned codon patterns. His ears perked up.</p><p>“Like, actual genes?”</p><p>“Yeah. <em>FOXO3A</em>, mostly. Some <em>NRG1</em>.”</p><p>Mattias leaned forward. “That’s neural stuff, isn’t it?”</p><p>Zoe smiled. “Longevity. Memory. Maybe even consciousness.”</p><p>She told him a bit about her past—working with <a href="http://www.oriongenomics.com/en/">Orion Genomics</a>, running custom filters on methylation patterns in cancer subtypes. But it was the cat story that caught him off guard.</p><p>“You were the one behind the allergy-free cat?”</p><p>Zoe laughed. “Yes, as part of the Sigma-Aldrich <a href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/products/molecular-biology-and-functional-genomics/gene-editing-and-functional-genomics/crispr-gene-editing">Gene Editing Team</a>, before Millipore bought it. We used ZFNs to suppress the allergen Fel d 1 [<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20110023156A1/en">US Patent</a> ] CRISPR wasn’t even cool yet.”</p><p>“You literally rewrote evolution to let people cuddle kittens,” Mattias said, half-joking.</p><p>“It was either that or keep selling allergy meds,” she replied. “Science for peace.”</p><p>He nodded. “But this work now—it’s what? Science for what?”</p><p>Zoe looked up at the sky. “Maybe science for the soul.”</p><h2>Into the Library</h2><p>The next morning, Zoe wound her way to the <a href="https://www.nli.org.il/en">National Library of Israel</a>, nestled beside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset">Knesset</a> in the Givat Ram campus. The limestone exterior gave way to clean glass corridors and digital displays. One exhibit featured digitized scrolls from the Geniza, glowing with multispectral color bands, each artifact a time-stamped echo of vanished lives.</p><p>In a reserved room, Zoe met Professor Alan Rosenberg—silver hair, linen suit, eyes that looked like they could spot a typo in a Torah scroll at twenty paces. His badge read “Dept. of Science &amp; Theology.”</p><p>“These Geniza fragments,” he said, tapping a projection screen, “show Y-H-V-H repeating every 42 characters. We overlaid the codons. <em>FOXO3A</em> pops up. So does <em>NRG1</em>. We ran the alignments in triplicate.”</p><p>Zoe leaned in, heart speeding. “This isn’t Bible Code fantasy. This is structured genomic encoding.”</p><p>She ran her latest <code>tile_blast_csv.py</code> script, outputting tiled regions in CSV, parsed and rendered into a histogram by <code>blast_graph.py</code>. The overlap with known enhancers blew her mind. This was more than coincidence. It was architecture.</p><h2>The Third Seat</h2><p>The door opened. Dr. Mirna Ashur entered—dark hair, crisp blouse, sharper eyes. Known for eviscerating pseudo-scientific ELS claims, she was a paleographer who worshipped in ink and parchment.</p><p>“Professor,” she nodded. “These new slips—920s Kufic, likely from Fustat. Diacriticals intact.”</p><p>She glanced at the projection. “I don’t like being surprised. But I’ll admit, these aren’t your typical Torah Codes.”</p><p>Zoe smirked. “Feels more like code-switching between protein and prophecy.”</p><p>Mirna raised a brow. “Let’s not get messianic.”</p><h2>Code and Covenant</h2><p>They spent hours together. Zoe’s tools parsed long noncoding regions looking for symbolic recurrence. Rosenberg annotated letter-skip matrices using a modified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_code#Equidistant_letter_sequence_method">ELS algorithm</a>. Mirna checked the orthographic consistency of ancient Hebrew glyphs using AI-augmented scroll reconstruction software.</p><p>Zoe shared an older hypothesis she’d shelved during the hypoallergenic cat project: that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codon_degeneracy">codon degeneracy</a> might encode a parallel information layer—spiritual or mnemonic, depending on the context.</p><p>“You’re saying evolution left post-it notes?” Rosenberg asked.</p><p>“Or maybe,” Zoe said, “someone wrote them in.”</p><h2>The Crucible Ahead</h2><p>Night fell again. From the rooftop, the city looked like it was dreaming. Tomorrow’s plenary would include physicists, Kabbalists, and an Oxford AI linguist who believed divine syntax was fractal.</p><p>Zoe sealed her tablet, encrypted the logs, and looked once more across the lit-up skyline.</p><p>Somewhere in those alleys was a code older than DNA. Maybe what mattered now wasn’t decoding it completely—but proving that it had always been there.</p><p>And that maybe, just maybe, we’d been reading it all along.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://joebedell.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">In Our Image is a reader-supported publication.
